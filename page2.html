    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Qp0J4QW/Mr-FML-S1-E1-thumbnail.png" alt=“Jacob” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">JACOB aka MR. FML (middle)</p>
      <p>Jacob tries to be a nice and good person, but he seems to always get the short end of the stick regardless. He will stand up for himself and call out nonsense, but overall there isn't much he can do in most situations.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/SJr34Lw/Mr-FML-S1-E2-Pic-2.png" alt=“Derek” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">DEREK</p>
      <p>One of Jacob's roommates who can appear nice, but can also appear very stuck up and demanding. Derek doesn't like swearing or anything that could distrupt his piece of mind.</p>
       <img src="https://i.ibb.co/VMpy80v/Mr-FML-S1-E3-Pic-1.png" alt=“Alex” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">ALEX</p>
      <p>Jacob's other roommate, who seems to of lost many brain cells over the years because of the dumb things he says. In Alex's own mind he is a genius. However, when it comes to how most people view him, it's actually the complete opposite.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/b71jk3X/Mr-FML-S1-E1-Pic-2.png" alt=“Brock” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">BROCK</p>
      <p>Brock is the neighborhood bully who picks on people constantly. He always claims people owe him money when in reality, his excuses as to why they owe him money are shakey at best. Once Brock set's his mind on something, it's almost impossible to stop him, as Brock's biggest strength is brute force.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tJKgn3X/Mr-FML-S1-E1-Pic-3.png" alt=“Rebecca” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">REBECCA</p>
      <p>Rebecca appears very sweet at times, however, sometimes her dark side slips through the cracks. It makes people wonder if she's actually a nice girl or if it's all just an act.</p>
      <img src="https://i.ibb.co/tQcLXzP/Mr-FML-S1-E2-Pic-7.png" alt=“Alice” style="width:350px;height:200px;">
      <p style="color:blue;">ALICE</p>
      <p>Alice is a close friend of Jacob's and is actually the one who linked him up with his roommates Derek and Alex, as she knew both of them before he did. Alice is a very kind and genuine person, one of the very few in Jacob's life who seems completely normal.</p>
