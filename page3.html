      <p>Jacob reflects on an odd day he had within the first few weeks of living with Derek and Alex. What started as Derek's supposed "tour around the neighborhood" turned into much more than that, including the discovery of a group with a strange and unexpected "business".</p>

<p style="color:blue;">Mr. FML (S1E3) Lights. Camera. Awful!!</p>
      <p>This time around, Jacob tells a story about the time when he was forced into helping Derek out for a short film that he was making. Doesn't sound too bad right? Well it wouldn't be...if Derek knew what he was doing.</p>
